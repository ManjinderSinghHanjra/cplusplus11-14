Scheduling Algorithms
---------------------

FCFS
SJF
Priority Scheduling
Round Robin (Fair amount of time to every process)
Multilevel Queue Scheduling
Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling

(Waiting, Running, Ready, Terminated)


Note: Some critical sections of code protect themselves from concurrency problems by disabling interrupts before entering the critical section and re-enabling interrupts on exiting the section.


Thread Scheduling
-----------------

Contention Scope
Process Contention Scope()
System Contention Scope()


Multiprocessor Scheduling
-------------------------

Load Sharing
Asymmetric Multiprocessing (master-slave)
SMP	(Processors are independent to schedule their jobs, either from a common ready queueor separate one)

Processor Affinity (soft affinity/ hard affinity)
Load Balancing (Push Migration/ Pull Migration)
